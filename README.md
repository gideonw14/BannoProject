# BannoProject
My project for the Banno JHA internship
---------------------------------------
I have posted a Visual Studio Project. The only way I know how to run it
is through Visual Studio debugger. From my point of view on the localhost
everything works fine. Hopefully you will be able to clone this project 
and use it in Visual Studio to see it for yourself. It is an ASP.NET application.

The heavy lifting of this project occurs under
BannoProject/WebApplication2/WebApplication2/Views/Home/PullHtml.cshtml
This is where all of the requirements are met:
+ A count of the number of Platform Features offered.
+ The top 3 occuring alphanumeric characters contained in the HTML, and how
many times each occurs.
+ The number of .png images in the HTML.
+ BannoJHA’s Twitter handle: this should work if the Twitter name were to change.
+ The number of times the term “financial institution” occurs in text.
